# Fudan RPML Assignment2: Deep Learning Meets News

In this assignment, you will build a text classification system which is a fundamental task in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). More precisely, you are given a news classification task, assigning given news texts to the categories to which they belong. Unlike traditional classification tasks, we did not provide you with any labels for this assignment, and you need to find a way to construct labels for these articles.

For this assignment you can use commonly used deep learning frameworks like paddle and pytorch, and should use at least one kind of deep neural network for this task. You can use pretrained word vectors like Glove, but not pretrained large models like BERT.
