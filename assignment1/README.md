In this assignment, you will use what you have learned to tackle some pratical problems. Fashion MNIST dataset[1] is the MNIST-like fashion product database for image classification you will play with this time. It originally consists of a training set of 60000 examples and a test set of 10000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.

To make this task more realistic, we selected 14600 labeled examples from the training set and did a little processing. You have to do this image classifictaion task with our new dataset. 

You have to impletement several standard classification methods in the './fudanPRML' folder:
- K-nearest Neighbor (15 points)
- Softmax (15 points)
- Neural Network (30 points)
and then do your exploration (30 points).

You can only use some basic python libraries in your experiment like numpy, paddle(without using the paddle.nn), matplotlib and so on. And please write down the version with them in the './requirements.txt' file.
